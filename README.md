# Small Queer Word Game

A Wordle-like word guessing game with a queer-themed word list. 

## About

This is a simple HTML5 reimplementation of the popular word game Wordle, with a selection of queer-themed and positive words. The game challenges you to guess a 5-letter word in 6 attempts.

## How to Play

1. Guess the 5-letter word in 6 tries
2. Each guess must be a valid 5-letter word
3. After each guess, the color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word:
   - Green: The letter is in the word and in the correct position
   - Yellow: The letter is in the word but in the wrong position
   - Gray: The letter is not in the word
