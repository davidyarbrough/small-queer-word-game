SQWG (pronounced "skoog") is a simple word guessing game. If you want to play a word game but DON'T want to support 
news outlets that amplify eugenicists, have I got a game for you.

## How to Play

1. Guess the 5-letter word in 6 tries
2. Each guess must be a valid 5-letter word
3. After each guess, the color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word:
   - Green: The letter is in the word and in the correct position
   - Yellow: The letter is in the word but in the wrong position
   - Gray: The letter is not in the word

## Running the Game

Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser to play the game.

## Technology

Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
